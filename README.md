# Auction-Project
Program that serves the purposes of an auction site.
Users are broken up into three categories: Admins, Auctioneers, and Customers.  
Admin users can create Auctioneer users, while Auctioneer users can create, start, and end auction listings.  
Customer users have an account balance which they can add money to, and view all auction listings, add or remove listings to a watch list, filter listings based on the category of the item listed, make bids, and view listings in which they are the highest bidder.
